# MiNiFi Native Rust

This repository provides a safe, idiomatic, and high-performance Rust framework for building native extensions (processors) for [Apache NiFi MiNiFi C++](https://github.com/apache/nifi-minifi-cpp)

It is designed to offer a robust developer experience, allowing you to write powerful and reliable data processing components in safe Rust.

The framework completely encapsulates the unsafe C FFI (Foreign Function Interface) boundary, providing a pure Rust API that is fully mockable for unit testing.

## Project Philosophy
 - **Safety First**: Leverage Rust's compile-time guarantees to prevent common bugs like null pointers, buffer overflows, and data races.
 - **Zero-Cost Abstraction**: The safe API wrapper is designed to compile down with zero runtime overhead compared to writing raw C FFI code.
 - **Ergonomics**: Provide a clean, idiomatic Rust API that is a pleasure to use. Developers should not need to think about unsafe code or C++ interoperability.
 - **Testability**: Every component of a processor's logic should be unit-testable in a pure Rust environment, without needing a C++ host.
 - **Cross Platform**: The library should work on all platforms that are supported by [Apache NiFi MiNiFi C++](https://github.com/apache/nifi-minifi-cpp)
   - macOS (aarch64)
   - Linux (x86_64, aarch64)
   - Windows (x86_64)


The project is structured as a Cargo workspace with a clear, layered architecture:
### [minifi-native-sys](minifi_native_sys)
Contains the raw, unsafe FFI bindings to the minifi-c.h C API.
### [minifi-native](minifi_native)
Provides the public, safe, and idiomatic Rust API. This is the crate that developers will use to build their processors.
#### API Traits
Pure Rust traits (Processor, ProcessSession, Logger, etc.) that define the abstract behavior of the MiNiFi environment.
#### Higher level API
Pure rust traits that simplify the requirements for a working processor
  - FlowFileTransform
  - FlowFileSource
#### FFI Wrappers
Concrete structs (CffiSession, CffiLogger, etc.) that implement the API traits by calling the unsafe functions from minifi-native-sys.
#### Thread safety
The trait system differentiates between thread-safe (&self) and single-threaded (&mut self) processors at compile time.
#### Comprehensive Mocking:
A full suite of mock objects allows for fast and reliable unit testing of all processor logic.

### [minifi_rs_behave](minifi_rs_behave)
Run the behave integration tests using Minifi's docker framework. This will test the release artifacts against the latest released [MiNiFi native docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/nifi-minifi-cpp).
There is a handy alias to initiate all behave tests.

`cargo behave`

## Extensions
### [minifi_rs_playground](minifi_rs_playground)
A concrete example of a processor extension built using the minifi-native crate.
- Demonstrates how to implement the Processor traits. Shows how to define properties and relationships.
- Includes comprehensive unit tests using the mocking framework.
- Includes integration testing that verifies the processor works as expected in a real MiNiFi environment.

### [minifi_pgp](minifi_pgp)
An extension that uses [rpgp](https://docs.rs/pgp/latest/pgp/) to mimic NiFi's [pgp-nar's](https://nifi.apache.org/docs/nifi-docs/components/org.apache.nifi/nifi-pgp-nar/) functionality
- EncryptContentPGP
- DecryptContentPGP

## How to Use the Library in the MiNiFi C++ Application
Copy the shared library (.so, .dll, or .dylib) to the MiNiFi C++ application's extensions/ directory.
