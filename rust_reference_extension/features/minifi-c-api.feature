  Scenario Outline: The LogAttributeRs can read and log FlowFile content
    Given a GenerateFlowFileRs processor with the "Custom Text" property set to "<custom_text>"

    And the "Unique FlowFiles" property of the GenerateFlowFileRs processor is set to "false"
    And a LogAttributeRs processor with the "Log Level" property set to "<log_level>"
    And the "Log Payload" property of the LogAttributeRs processor is set to "true"
    And the "success" relationship of the GenerateFlowFileRs processor is connected to the LogAttributeRs
    And LogAttributeRs's success relationship is auto-terminated
    And log property "logger.rust_reference_extension::processors::log_attribute::LogAttributeRs" is set to "TRACE,stderr"

    When the MiNiFi instance starts up

    Then the Minifi logs contain the following message: "<expected_log_1>" in less than 20 seconds
    And the Minifi logs contain the following message: "<expected_log_2>" in less than 1 seconds
    And the Minifi logs do not contain errors
    And the Minifi logs do not contain warnings
    Examples:
      | custom_text | log_level | expected_log_1                   | expected_log_2 |
      | Elephant    | Critical  | [critical] Logging for flow file | Elephant       |
      | Lynx        | Info      | [info] Logging for flow file     | Lynx           |
      | Ant         | Trace     | [trace] Logging for flow file    | Ant            |

  Scenario: The Api handles empty flow-files
    Given a GenerateFlowFileRs processor with the "Custom Text" property set to "${invalid_attribute}"

    And LogAttributeRs's success relationship is auto-terminated

    When the MiNiFi instance starts up

    Then after 3 sec have passed
    And the Minifi logs do not contain errors

  Scenario: Minifi handles errors from on_schedule
    Given a KamikazeProcessorRs processor with the "On Schedule Behaviour" property set to "ReturnErr"
    And KamikazeProcessorRs's success relationship is auto-terminated

    When the MiNiFi instance starts up

    Then the Minifi logs contain the following message: "(KamikazeProcessorRs): Process Schedule Operation: Error while scheduling processor" in less than 3 seconds

  Scenario: Panic in extension's on_schedule crashes the agent aswell
    Given a KamikazeProcessorRs processor with the "On Schedule Behaviour" property set to "Panic"
    And KamikazeProcessorRs's success relationship is auto-terminated

    When the MiNiFi instance is started without assertions
    Then Minifi crashes with the following "KamikazeProcessor::on_schedule panic" in less than 10 seconds

  Scenario: Minifi handles errors from on_trigger
    Given a KamikazeProcessorRs processor with the "On Schedule Behaviour" property set to "ReturnOk"
    And the "On Trigger Behaviour" property of the KamikazeProcessorRs processor is set to "ReturnErr"
    And KamikazeProcessorRs's success relationship is auto-terminated

    When the MiNiFi instance starts up

    Then the Minifi logs contain the following message: "Trigger and commit failed for processor KamikazeProcessorRs" in less than 3 seconds

  Scenario: Panic in extension's on_trigger crashes the agent aswell
    Given a KamikazeProcessorRs processor with the "On Schedule Behaviour" property set to "ReturnOk"
    And the "On Trigger Behaviour" property of the KamikazeProcessorRs processor is set to "Panic"
    And KamikazeProcessorRs's success relationship is auto-terminated

    When the MiNiFi instance is started without assertions
    Then Minifi crashes with the following "KamikazeProcessor::on_trigger panic" in less than 10 seconds

  Scenario Outline: Controller services work
    Given a LoremIpsumCSUser processor with the "Lorem Ipsum Controller Service" property set to "LoremIpsumControllerService"
    And the "Write Method" property of the LoremIpsumCSUser processor is set to "<write_method>"
    And a LoremIpsumControllerService controller service is set up and the "Length" property set to "200000"
    And a PutFileRs processor with the "Directory" property set to "/tmp/output"
    And the "success" relationship of the LoremIpsumCSUser processor is connected to the PutFileRs
    And PutFileRs's success relationship is auto-terminated

    When the MiNiFi instance starts up

    Then at least one file with minimum size of "1 MB" is placed in the "/tmp/output" directory in less than 10 seconds
    And the Minifi logs do not contain errors
    And the Minifi logs do not contain warnings
    Examples:
      | write_method |
      | Buffer       |
